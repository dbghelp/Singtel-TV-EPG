		<desc>重案組沙展方瓦仔（林保怡）自小在新界圍村長大，深受同袍愛戴。瓦仔工作拼搏，自以為升職在望。一天，總部空降新上司高級督察馬考賢（馬德鐘），頓時令他的世界改變了。一個講義氣，處事圓滑；一個無情講，執法嚴明；究竟寬鬆的處事手法還是嚴苛的辦案方式在新界圍村可以奏效？大男人的瓦仔只寄情工作，經常託同僚陶展雄（陳浩民）照顧女友劉玉欣（姚瑩瑩），造就了他倆的感情發展，令瓦仔在愛情上走進危機。恰巧，與瓦仔青梅竹馬的醫生陸迎璋（郭可盈）同時要承受男友身亡的悲痛，又要履行承諾照顧男友的另一懷有身孕的女友溫嘉莉（楊怡），可謂苦不堪言。瓦仔與璋同是天涯淪落人，互相扶持，瓦仔對璋漸生愛意，惜璋只視他為兄長，反對瓦仔的上司賢有好感，但賢因曾受傷未癒而埋藏對璋的愛意。璋鼓勵賢面對挑戰接受手術，這次手術能否令兩人的感情跨進一大步？瓦仔被璋拒絕後，常被莉取笑作弄，但相處下漸漸發覺與莉十分投契，莉亦不禁對他產生好感。然而，瓦仔對感情卻優柔寡斷，他對璋是否真的未能忘情？對莉的感情又是否只是一種施捨呢？</desc>
