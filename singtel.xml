中國古人用艾草做藥，歷史悠久，原來外敷有除濕止癢的妙效，可改善體臭，留意醫師傳授艾草藥敷包的製法和使用須知。大家平日享用的食物有機會影響體味，喬寶寶至愛的咖喱蘊含大量香料，自然不在話下，不過吃西蘭花竟然都會產生體臭？坊間有不少產品助人減輕汗味，止汗劑和香體露哪個比較有效？</desc>

體味除臭攻略‧麥美恩、喬寶寶
香港天氣炎熱，令人容易出汗，當汗水與皮膚表面的細菌分解，就自然形成氣味。可是，有部份朋友的汗臭味特別濃烈，原因何在？皮膚科專科醫生陳厚毅解釋汗腺與「臭狐」的關係，還指出臭狐都有遺傳性。腳臭與狐臭的原因同出一轍，坊間有指穿着五趾襪可減腳臭，張致恆即場做實驗，嘉賓麥美恩以天生靈敏的「神鼻」一嗅分別，驗證說法真偽，絕對是為醫學而犧牲！

中國古人用艾草做藥，歷史悠久，原來外敷有除濕止癢的妙效，可改善體臭，留意醫師傳授艾草藥敷包的製法和使用須知。大家平日享用的食物有機會影響體味，喬寶寶至愛的咖喱蘊含大量香料，自然不在話下，不過吃西蘭花竟然都會產生體臭？坊間有不少產品助人減輕汗味，止汗劑和香體露哪個比較有效？</desc>
