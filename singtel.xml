		<title>粤讲粤㜺鬼 / Cantoxicating! (Sr. 3) Episode 8</title>
		<desc>粤语既新潮又怀旧，亦有通俗、古雅的一体两面。广东话被喻为古汉语的「活化石」，当中「几多」、「旧时」自古诗词开始沿用至今，细看还可发现更多历史痕迹。

不少传统行业与手艺或逐渐被遗忘，从中衍生的歇后语、俗语却走进潮流，融入普罗市民家中。许多耳熟能详的日常字句，更与历史及本土民生息息相关！

节目第三辑，麦美恩、吴幸美、黄耀英加上新主持拍档黄建东，联同专家们继续拆解粤语的妙趣之处，重新唤起大众对广东话的关注。</desc>

林月如独自一人来到贫民窟，为李逍遥寻找之前的独臂老乞丐，却遭到一群人围攻，原来是之前的小混混们心存怨念前来报复。林月如虽武艺高强，但还是中了暗算，被迷晕掳走。老乞丐见状连忙通风报信，李逍遥和刘晋元及时赶到，救出林月如。
因祸得福，李逍遥意外得知老乞丐就是与李三思渊源颇深的铁臂神鹰皇甫英。铁臂神鹰说出了当年自己与李三思的恩怨纠葛，证明了李三思并非恶人，去南诏也是为了救人而非偷盗水灵珠。一番言语如同强心剂，让李逍遥更加确信追回赵灵儿的决心，独自一人连夜出发。刘晋元突然病倒，却依旧鼓励林月如遵从本心去追李逍遥。刘晋元命家仆牵了两匹好马给月如送行，并送给她一对玉佩，释然了自己对月如的一片痴情，林月如心下感激，上马追赶李逍遥，并把玉佩的一半送给李逍遥，逍遥月如两人策马而行。</desc>

健康减肥食疗‧岑丽香、林盛斌
肥仔、肥妹四海皆是，根据世卫纪录，原来全球有十九亿人拥有超重问题。医学界专称的肥胖是指人体脂肪过多，普遍采用身高体重指数(BMI)来评估肥瘦，可是BMI达目标人也不代表完全过关，因为还有一种脂肪过量的案例，叫作中央肥胖。怎样才知道自己是否中央肥胖？今集请来香港肥胖医学会会长周振中，为岑丽香、林盛斌(Bob)用专门方法量度腰围。

中医认为肥胖与湿热有关，一般袪湿、利水的食疗对减肥益处多多，黄淑仪介绍一款「Gi补靓汤」，以北芪、冬瓜、荷叶等食材助各位调理身体。不少办公室女郎喜欢午餐吃沙律菜减肥，但份量不足仅够充饥，饭后肚饿起来乱吃零食，反而适得其反。营养顾问Elsa示范「羽衣甘蓝沙律」，教你饱肚减肥。勤做运动是减肥的不二法门，瑜伽导师Louise传授手肘平板支撑动作，燃烧身体各大部位的脂肪。</desc>
