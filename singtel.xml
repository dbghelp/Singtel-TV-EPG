		<title>射鵰英雄傳之鐵血丹心 / Legend of the Condor Heroes (I), The Episode 13</title>
		<desc>改編自武俠小說宗師金庸先生暢銷之鉅著「射鵰英雄傳」。全真教長丘處機為金兵追殺，得郭嘯天、楊鐵心兩結義兄弟相助，倖免於難，詎料卻因此令郭、楊兩家遭滅門之禍。金國皇子當日得睹楊妻包惜弱芳容，驚為天人，逐設計使人殺害兩家，再哄騙惜弱下嫁，嘯天力戰身亡，而鐵心則不知所踪，郭妻輾轉逃往蒙古，更在大漠中產下遺腹子郭靖。惜弱雖嫁入皇府，然終未忘舊侶，未幾產下楊康。丘道長驚聞噩耗，誓保故友遺孤，卻在途中因誤會與江南七怪手打出手，未分勝負，雙方訂約，分別找郭、楊後代，授以武功，十八年後，江南比武，再分高下。歲月怱怱，比武之期已近，七怪與郭靖同下江南。是時郭靖得七怪指導，已練得一身武藝，又因剛直忠勇，得鐵木真所喜，賜封金刀駙馬，而楊康因生於王府，驕縱成性，道長則暗中傳以武功。抵達中原，郭靖巧遇黃蓉從此結下不解之緣，雙雙闖蕩江湖。話分兩頭，鐵心毀家後，即埋名隱姓，後收養義女穆念慈共同浪跡天涯，以期訪查愛妻下落，卻因比武招親事，種下楊康與念慈的一段孽緣，並展開郭、黃楊、穆四人之間日後的種種恩怨。</desc>
