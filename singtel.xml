米製品
對於用米製作食品，潮汕人別具心得，粿條、腸粉等皆為米製美食。潮州粥配上稱為「雜鹹」的潮汕冷盤小菜，就是當地人的日常滋味。主持與嘉賓楊潮凱看到桌上108道雜鹹，未吃已感震撼！

用糯米包出的「糭球」，可一次嚐到鹹甜兩種味道；由海中薄殼加工而來的「薄殼米」，又是地道的潮汕風味，還可製成薄殼米粿。

三姐配合米製品主題，炮製「老菜脯蜆蟹粥」、「薄殼韭菜煎蛋角」與「沙嗲豬肉鴛鴦麵」。粥品僅加入魚露，已經鮮味無窮。</desc>

米製品
對於用米製作食品，潮汕人別具心得，粿條、腸粉等皆為米製美食。潮州粥配上稱為「雜鹹」的潮汕冷盤小菜，就是當地人的日常滋味。主持與嘉賓楊潮凱看到桌上108道雜鹹，未吃已感震撼！

用糯米包出的「糭球」，可一次嚐到鹹甜兩種味道；由海中薄殼加工而來的「薄殼米」，又是地道的潮汕風味，還可製成薄殼米粿。

三姐配合米製品主題，炮製「老菜脯蜆蟹粥」、「薄殼韭菜煎蛋角」與「沙嗲豬肉鴛鴦麵」。粥品僅加入魚露，已經鮮味無窮。</desc>
