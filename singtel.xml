中医角度，肾和脑的关系密不可分，补肾对益智有莫大帮助，由核桃、圆肉、益智仁等煲成的「核桃老鸽汤」绝对是加强记性之佳品。不同的食物亦可改善记忆力，蓝莓、西兰花营养丰富，不妨多吃；猪脑在中国传统有以形补形之说，在营养师的眼中又是否有益？还要留意中医师示范「补脑操」，提升脑部血液供应。</desc>

健忘可改善‧森美、朱千雪
你可有经常忘记事物的经验？医学上有种病叫作健忘症，记性差的人首当其冲是高危一族。要知道自己是否患者，脑神经科专科医生袁孟豪介绍一项视觉空间记忆测试，参加者要倒序列出八个数字的出现位置和时序，森美、朱千雪接受测试，谁竟然只答对两题？增强记忆可靠后天特训，记忆力训练导师李鉴峰示范在一分半钟内，背诵出二十组由现场观众随意写下的双位数字，并将个中的记忆窍门与大家分享。

中医角度，肾和脑的关系密不可分，补肾对益智有莫大帮助，由核桃、圆肉、益智仁等煲成的「核桃老鸽汤」绝对是加强记性之佳品。不同的食物亦可改善记忆力，蓝莓、西兰花营养丰富，不妨多吃；猪脑在中国传统有以形补形之说，在营养师的眼中又是否有益？还要留意中医师示范「补脑操」，提升脑部血液供应。</desc>
