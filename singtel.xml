		<desc>反黑組幹探喜(吳毅將)個性剛強，從不妥協，屢破奇案。奈何喜慣於獨斷獨行，未能配合其他同僚，特別是其上司凡(黎耀祥)及剛加入的康(陳浩民)，遂萌退出之意。後喜與康合作多了，了解日深，終成了知心友。康更令喜重拾衝勁，與一眾隊友弟(邵美琪)、草蜢仔(洪天明)、佛爺(關菁)等，合力偵破不少重案，如「慈雲山霸王」、「學校風雲」、「漁市場風暴」及「幻影英雄」等等。這群反黑先鋒在感情方面，卻各有際遇：康與凡在查案過程中，分別認識了任教師的心(何韻詩)和賣魚女嬌(蘇玉華)，展開戀情。但喜的愛妻芝(楊婉儀)在一次意外中喪生，喜傷痛欲絕，暗戀喜多時的弟默默安慰扶持，究竟喜與弟最後會否走在一起？</desc>
