頭痛成因大解構‧袁偉豪、劉佩玥
頭痛是非常普遍的身體小毛病，而根據權威組織的標準，可分為原發性和繼發性兩種。前者並無明確病因，主要包括偏頭痛、頸椎病變性頭痛等；後者多數由其他疾病，例如腦出血、腦腫瘤所引起。若然你發現自己經常「頭赤赤」，卻不懂判斷身體哪個地方出現問題，不妨跟脊醫朱銘謙以兩套簡單動作，找出癥結所在。

天麻、川芎、白芷有止痛功效，配合大魚頭、瘦肉、紅棗等材料，就可製成「天麻魚頭燉湯」這款香氣四溢的食療，助大家行氣通絡。「一日一蘋果，醫生遠離我」，吃蘋果好處多多，就連醫頭痛都有一手，除此之外，深海魚和芝士哪樣不適宜長期頭痛人士食用？頭痛往往要來便來，註冊中醫師梁寧茵教各位四個舒緩不適的穴道，以備不時之需。</desc>
