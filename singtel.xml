		<title>粤讲粤㜺鬼 / Cantoxicating! (Sr. 3) Episode 5</title>
		<desc>粤语既新潮又怀旧，亦有通俗、古雅的一体两面。广东话被喻为古汉语的「活化石」，当中「几多」、「旧时」自古诗词开始沿用至今，细看还可发现更多历史痕迹。

不少传统行业与手艺或逐渐被遗忘，从中衍生的歇后语、俗语却走进潮流，融入普罗市民家中。许多耳熟能详的日常字句，更与历史及本土民生息息相关！

节目第三辑，麦美恩、吴幸美、黄耀英加上新主持拍档黄建东，联同专家们继续拆解粤语的妙趣之处，重新唤起大众对广东话的关注。</desc>

三年转瞬即逝，又逢乌骨里忌日。燕燕在佛龛前心情不虞，韩德让看着燕燕落寞的样子暗自心疼。燕燕感慨自乌骨里去后，胡辇往来书信都是政务，鲜有亲情。
另一边，胡辇追逐猎物穿过树林，看到了上身赤裸，正在湖边刷马的马奴，谁知胡辇坐骑突然受惊扬蹄。危急时刻，挞览阿钵冲过来跳上马背，救下胡辇。胡辇想要赏赐挞览阿钵。挞览阿钵拒绝，而是邀请胡辇明日前来草原部落。
韩德让寿辰将至，燕燕念其辛苦，要在宫中为他做寿。韩德让拒绝，认为于理不合，燕燕说韩德让身为相父，自然当得起这样的礼遇。燕燕还当众为韩德让建立斡鲁朵。燕燕此举让虎古等人愤懑不已。
