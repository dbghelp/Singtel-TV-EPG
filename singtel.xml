體味除臭攻略‧麥美恩、喬寶寶
香港天氣炎熱，令人容易出汗，當汗水與皮膚表面的細菌分解，就自然形成氣味。可是，有部份朋友的汗臭味特別濃烈，原因何在？皮膚科專科醫生陳厚毅解釋汗腺與「臭狐」的關係，還指出臭狐都有遺傳性。腳臭與狐臭的原因同出一轍，坊間有指穿着五趾襪可減腳臭，張致恆即場做實驗，嘉賓麥美恩以天生靈敏的「神鼻」一嗅分別，驗證說法真偽，絕對是為醫學而犧牲！

中國古人用艾草做藥，歷史悠久，原來外敷有除濕止癢的妙效，可改善體臭，留意醫師傳授艾草藥敷包的製法和使用須知。大家平日享用的食物有機會影響體味，喬寶寶至愛的咖喱蘊含大量香料，自然不在話下，不過吃西蘭花竟然都會產生體臭？坊間有不少產品助人減輕汗味，止汗劑和香體露哪個比較有效？</desc>

頭痛是非常普遍的身體小毛病，而根據權威組織的標準，可分為原發性和繼發性兩種。前者並無明確病因，主要包括偏頭痛、頸椎病變性頭痛等；後者多數由其他疾病，例如腦出血、腦腫瘤所引起。若然你發現自己經常「頭赤赤」，卻不懂判斷身體哪個地方出現問題，不妨跟脊醫朱銘謙以兩套簡單動作，找出癥結所在。

天麻、川芎、白芷有止痛功效，配合大魚頭、瘦肉、紅棗等材料，就可製成「天麻魚頭燉湯」這款香氣四溢的食療，助大家行氣通絡。「一日一蘋果，醫生遠離我」，吃蘋果好處多多，就連醫頭痛都有一手，除此之外，深海魚和芝士哪樣不適宜長期頭痛人士食用？頭痛往往要來便來，註冊中醫師梁寧茵教各位四個舒緩不適的穴道，以備不時之需。</desc>
