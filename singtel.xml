They have since become the dominant power in English football and we look at how it all began.</desc>

撻覽阿缽私自率人去營中整兵，帶兵刺傷前去巡營的隆緒，雖已無性命之虞但險些傷及要害。撻覽阿缽被關進大牢，隆緒也回到宮接受醫治。胡輦為撻覽阿缽求情，但被隆緒拒絕。
胡輦憤而劫獄，救下撻覽阿缽逃回北方，韓德讓下令蕭繼先帶兵追擊。燕燕感歎這一次真的失去大姐了。
撻覽阿缽命懸一線，最後死在胡輦懷中。蕭繼先率兵攻入城內，將胡輦帶回上京。眾大臣紛紛上奏殺掉胡輦以正朝綱，胡輦依然執迷不悟，對燕燕心灰意冷。燕燕內心十分難受，最終無奈下旨，將皇太妃胡輦永囚於懷州，終身不得釋。
數年後，燕燕興建新都，遷都南京（即今天的北京）。遷都之後，她還政兒子耶律隆緒（遼聖宗），含笑逝于韓德讓懷中，並留下遺囑，令韓得讓與自己合葬。</desc>
