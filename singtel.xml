		<title>燕云台 / The Legend of Xiao Chuo Episode 617044</title>
		<desc>第三十五集

燕燕想到韩德让留守幽州，十分担心。
韩德让与敌烈守城策略不同，敌烈冒进，不管韩德让如何阻拦，敌烈都一意孤行，执意领兵追伐，带走城中一万精锐驰援刘汉。
敌烈全军覆没，刘汉出城投降，南主一怒之下纵火烧了太原，下一步便会冲着大辽而来，而幽州已呈败象。韩德让安抚百姓，统筹军兵，做最后的部署，打算死守不降。
燕燕看到乌云盖雪带来的求救信，不顾众人阻拦，马上调兵遣将，亲自前往幽州支持。耶律贤劝阻无果，只好加派精兵跟随她一同解幽州之围。
韩德让以死守城，眼见要殉国，燕燕驾马而来，看到韩德让被围困在燕云台上，策马奔上燕云台，就在千钧一发之际，救下了韩德让，两人时隔多年在城楼之上再次相见，险些生死永隔。</desc>
